# Image Encryption and Decryption Using TEA in ECB and CBC Modes

This repository contains a Python script for encrypting and decrypting images using the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in both Electronic Codebook (ECB) and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) modes.

## Features

- Encryption and decryption of images using TEA algorithm.
- Support for both ECB and CBC modes.
- Image conversion to blocks for encryption.
- Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (`pip install pillow`)

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/AbdKhuffash/Image-Encryption-and-Decryption-Using-TEA-in-ECB-and-CBC-Modes.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```
    cd Image-Encryption-and-Decryption-Using-TEA-in-ECB-and-CBC-Modes
    ```


3. **Run the script:**
    ```
    python image_encryption.py
    ```

4. **Follow the instructions to enter the path or URL to the image, key, and IV (for CBC mode).**

7. **The encrypted and decrypted images will be displayed.**
